The run_analysis.R script

- merges data from the test data and the train data
- sets descriptive column & activity names for the merged data
- generates a tidy data set which contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject 
- writes the data generated to "tidyresult.txt" file

The CodeBook.md file explains all the variables and its transformations for the final result.
